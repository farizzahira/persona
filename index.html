<title>Me During MCO</title>
	
<body></body>
<p>Hi. During MCO session, I am being so stress because of a lot of assignment, doing housework and cooking. While online classes, my coverage at house is so bad but suprisingly at 1:00 a.m o'clock and above, my coverage was 4G. When I'm complete my task, I can not to submit it to iLearn/uFuture. I need to manage my time wisely since I'm at home</p>
<p>But, the benefits of MCO is, I can stay at home. Before this break, I never back home because of tasks require of my subject. Every morning when I wake up, I see that food at kitchen. How heaven!</p>
	<p>I hope that everyone stay at home like me. Stay safe!</p>
