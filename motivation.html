	<p>My Goals: <q>Get 4 flat in upcoming examination</q></p>
	<p>My motivations to get 4 flat:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.success.com/17-motivational-quotes-to-inspire-you-to-be-successful/">Dream bigger. Do bigger. To be successful, you have to use each day as an opportunity to improve, to be better, to get a little bit closer to your goals. It might sound like a lot of work and with a busy schedule, next to impossible. But the best part is, the more you accomplish, the more you will want to do, the higher you will want to reach. So as long as you have the hunger for success, you will always have the power within you to achieve it.</blockquote>
